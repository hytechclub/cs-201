# Game Enhancement Ideas
Here are some ideas for additional game features, to be added after the [walkthroughs](Walkthroughs/StudentDesc.md) have been completed.

- More sprite images
    - Animations, backgrounds, etc
- Different types of enemies (faster moving, quicker cooldown, different movement patterns, different images)
- Different types of projectiles (different movement patterns, faster, different shapes and sizes, multiple firing at once)
- Power-ups (faster movements, quicker cooldown, extra lives, extra points)
- A Title Screen image
- Sound effects
- Multiple levels
- New physics
